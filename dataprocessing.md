# Notes and methodology for data processing

## Shock code cross-walk
1. Household questionnaires (post-harvest) and community questionnaires downloaded from [World Bank](http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTLSMS/0,,contentMDK:23635478~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:3358997,00.html)
2. Shock pages extracted in Acrobat and converted into Excel sheets.
3. Coping codes and description broken into separate columns
4. Shock codes, descriptions, as well as coping codes, manually copy/pasted into a combined tidy Excel file.
5. Shocks and coping manually grouped into categories, and new codes assigned to be consistent across data sets.  
    - coping codes based on Ethiopia code numbers with additional values.
    - when there are two potential categories, the effect and not the cause prioritized, e.g. "harvest failure from poor rains"
6. Coping categories classified as good or bad:
